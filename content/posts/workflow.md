v.2025
see what I'm [[uses|using]] with this workflow

# Scheduling
**Google Calendar**
- See when you have stuff
- Available everywhere
	- Tried physical planner, too much

# To-Do List
**Obsidian + SyncTrazor**
- Easy to track across my devices. Used to use NeoVim but got lazy so I'm going back to Obsidian

**Physical DO list**
- Another physical area to keep track so I don't have to use phone
- Crossing off stuff feels good and you don't have to complete the whole list

# Habit Tracking
**Physical Notebook**
- Limits the amount you track so you can really focus on your main goals
- Again crossing stuff out just feels good and builds momentum
- See progress overtime

# Notetaking for Learning
**Nvim + Obsidian**
- Obsidian is simple and I'll use Nvim time to time to take notes
- Visual map of nodes is appealing to look at
