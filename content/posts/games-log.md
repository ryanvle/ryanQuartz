## WEBFISHING
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Cozy fishing game with cute graphics. Variety of fish you can catch. Fun single or multiplayer

## TEKKEN 8
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - 3D Fighter with a lot of interesting moves and characters. A lot harder than other traditional fighting games because of the third axis.

## Street Fighter 6
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Good game to get into the fighting genre

## Monster Hunter: World
⭐⭐⭐ - Like the world building and monsters. Hella grindy and only fun with friends

## Counter-Strike 2
⭐⭐⭐ - Don't like the new engine but it is a classic for me. Would've been 5 stars if it was CS:GO

## Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege
⭐⭐ - I get bored too fast

## FreeStyle 2: Street Basketball
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Lowkey a good sports game. Sometimes botchy netcode and p2w players

## Destiny 2
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Shooter MMO with fun raids, pvp and story. Just like most MMOs, hella grindy so it is not 5 stars

## Team Fortress 2
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Banger of a hero shooter and I'm excited to see what games come out since the TF2 SDK got released

## Apex Legends
⭐⭐⭐ - Solid battle royale but nothing pops out to me

## Albion Online
⭐⭐⭐ - Grindy but fun pvp if you like topdown such as RuneScape/LoL

## Black Desert
⭐⭐⭐ - The most fun pvp in a MMO I've played but outside of that it takes too much time

## Valorant
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Filled my Counter-strike void but also made the Tac FPS genre more interesting by adding abilities

## Garry's Mod
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Games inside of a game. Kinda dead but fun to come back to once in a while. Favorites are TTT and DarkRP

## Roblox
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Garry's Mod but for the newer generation

## Warframe
⭐⭐⭐ - Grind and grind. If you get hooked onto the story it's cool but not for me

## Rust
⭐⭐ - For goblins

## Baldur's Gate 3
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Amazing story and fun combat if you like D&D

## Terraria
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - A classic 2D survival craft game. Base game is enough fun but if you want more there is the Calamity mod

## League of Legends
⭐⭐⭐ - Took my life but made good friends along the way

## Teamfight Tactics
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Autochess genre is very unique and love seeing characters outside of the main game

## Maplestory
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - The music is peak and the game is very nostalgic to me. Would love to see an orchestra performance!

## Fortnite
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - The building mechanics are very fun to learn but over time the updates just got crazier, making it hard to keep up. First game I tried to go pro in but fell off lmao.

## Risk of Rain 2
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Roguelike with a lot of chaos and cool classes to play. Can add mods which makes the game more goofy. 

## Aragami
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Fun co op ninja game. Short and simple

## Aragami 2
⭐⭐⭐ - Tragedy has struck in the sequel.

## 9 Monkeys of Shaolin
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Co op game that me and my friend picked up for remote play. Beat 'em up game with a variety of moves you can do.
