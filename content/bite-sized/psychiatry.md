## What is Psychiatry?
**Psychiatry** is a branch in medicine that focuses on the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental, emotional and behavioral disorders.

Psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in mental health.

## Diagnosing Patients
Psychiatrists can help provide a picture of a patient's mental and physical state by conducting a full range of medical laboratory and psychological tests. With their experience in education and clinical training, they are well equipped to evaluate medical and psychological data, make a diagnosis, and work with patients to build treatment plans.

Specific diagnoses are based on _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ (_DSM-5_).
