## WEBFISHING
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Cozy fishing game with cute graphics. Variety of fish you can catch. Fun single or multiplayer.

## TEKKEN 8
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - 3D Fighter with a lot of interesting moves and characters. A lot harder than other traditional fighting games because of the third axis.

## Street Fighter 6
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Good game to get into the fighting genre.

## Monster Hunter: World
⭐⭐⭐ - Like the world building and monsters. Hella grindy and only fun with friends.

## Counter-Strike 2
⭐⭐⭐ - Don't like the new engine but it is a classic for me. Would've been 5 stars if it was CS:GO

## Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege
⭐⭐ - I get bored too fast

## FreeStyle 2: Street Basketball
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Lowkey a good sports game. Sometimes botchy netcode and p2w players.

## Destiny 2
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Shooter MMO with fun raids, pvp and story. Just like most MMOs, hella grindy so it is not 5 stars.

## Team Fortress 2
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Banger of a hero shooter and I'm excited to see what games come out since the TF2 SDK got released.

## Apex Legends
⭐⭐⭐ - Solid battle royale but nothing pops out to me

## Albion Online
⭐⭐⭐ - Grindy but fun pvp if you like topdown such as RuneScape/LoL

## Black Desert
⭐⭐⭐ - The most fun pvp in a MMO I've played but outside of that it takes too much time

## Valorant
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Filled my Counter-strike void but also made the Tac FPS genre more interesting by adding abilities.

## Garry's Mod
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Games inside of a game. Kinda dead but fun to come back to once in a while. Favorites are TTT and DarkRP

## Roblox
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Garry's Mod but for the newer generation.

## Warframe
⭐⭐⭐ - Grind and grind. If you get hooked onto the story it's cool but not for me

## Rust
⭐⭐ - For goblins

## Baldur's Gate 3
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Amazing story and fun combat if you like D&D.
