## What is digital gardening?
A digital garden is an in-between of personal blog and wiki. A collection of your thoughts, notes, ideas, essays that you cultivate over time. They're organized in contextual relationships and links rather than a single stream of thoughts that are sorted by a time-based structure.

A garden is less performative than a blog and encourages half-finished thoughts to be placed where the public can see.
