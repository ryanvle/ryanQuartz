Developing tastes serves as a guideline for what you like in the world and finding the unexpected within your life.

So how do you do it?
1. Save anything and everything to come back to or to think about later. Go down rabbit holes!
2. Go back through things regularly. Whether that be YouTube likes, screenshots, pantry, etc.
3. Find the edges. There are things that live in and outside of your taste sandbox. Hone in on what happens when you bring seemingly disparate things together.
4. Have high standards! Taste is about the choices you make, how you think, and what you notice. It's not reactive, it's intentional.
5. Craft your point-of-view with a well-formed opinion. Decide why you like things.
	- How does it relate to me?
	- What does it mean to me?
	- Why does it make me feel the way I do?
	- Why do I appreciate it or not?
	**Taste is majority self reflection.**
6. Notice how and when you **feel the most You.** Be in the present moment. Taste can be a way to bring yourself closer to your true self and to the world around you.
	- Is it a piece of clothing?
	- Cooking a certain meal?
	- Being in a specific setting?

This process is slow, iterative, and life-long. It's never finished and there is no "done." **Don't force it and don't try too hard!**
