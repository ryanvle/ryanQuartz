Been wanting to build a 3D game for a long time but never got around to it. In the past I tried to learn how to make a 2D game in Lua using the [LÃ¶ve](https://love2d.org/) Engine. Stopped because of other projects I hopped on.

This time I will be using the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) Engine because it is free, 2D/3D capability, and has a lot of resources on learning it.

First game I want to create is a [3D multiplayer shooter](3d-shooter-game).
