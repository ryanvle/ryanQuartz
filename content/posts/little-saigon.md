Little Saigon is a cultural hub for many Vietnamese Americans in Seattle.

## Early History
Before Little Saigon was established, the area was a home to the Jewish and Black community. 

1909 the Jewish Synagogue of Chevra Bikur Cholim was established. It became a place for people in the local Jewish community to gather. Present day it is now the Langston Hughes Performing Arts Institute (LHPAI). The institute houses LANGSTON Seattle, a non-profit whose mission is to strengthen and advance their community through Black arts and culture.
